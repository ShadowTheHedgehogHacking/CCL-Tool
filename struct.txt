Shadow the Hedgehog .CCL File Structure

===Section 1: Header;
    0x0: int; file size.
    0x4; int; length of data sections 2 and 3
    0x8; int; almost always 4, but in SECRETDOOR.CCL (the largest cmn .CCL file), is 8. Possibly because 0x4 is larger than FF?
    0xC; int; unknown. Always 1?
    0x10; int; unknown. null?
    0x14; "00003142"
    0x18; int; unknown. null?
    0x1C; int; unknown. null?

===Section 2: Shapes Array; (starts at 0x20)
    0x0; int; Collision Shape
        0: Sphere 
        1: Cube
        2: Cylinder
        3: Capsule
        4: Plane?
    0x4; int; sect 3 address relative to Section 2. (in other words, file address -0x20)
    0x8; byte: unknown
    0x9: byte: unknown
    0xA: byte: unknown
    0xB; byte: Collision type
        00: Intangible
        01: Floor (can grab)
        02: Wall (can wallcling)
        03: Floor? 
        06: Damage
    0xC; int?: unknown

Repeat the above for each seperate collision.
Then 0x10 00's padding.

===Section 3: Dimensions Array;
s
=Sphere=     Size : 0x10
    0x0; float; x position
    0x4; float; y position
    0x8; float; z position
    0xC; float; size

=Cube=        Size : 0x28

=Cylinder=    Size : 0x24

=Capsule=    Size : 0x24 
    0x00; X pos?
    0x04; Y pos
    0x08; Z pos?
    0x0C; height scale
    0x10; width scale
    0x14; Angle? Always (pi/2)
    0x18; ?
    0x1C; ?
    0x20; ?

=Plane?=    Size : 0x28
    0x00; X pos
    0x04; Y pos
    0x08; Z pos
    0x0C; Y scale?
    0x10; Z scale?
    0x14; X scale?
    0x18; Angle? Always (pi/2)
    0x1C; Y Rotation?
    0x20; Z Rotation?
    0x24; X Rotation?


===Section 4: Unknown 41 Section; 
SAME AS(?) SPLINE SECTION 5.
Difference in exact byte numbers though;
instead starts with 41, and additional bytes are 44.

===Section 5: File Path
Fills out the remainder of file size.
Presumed safe to ignore otherwise.
In-game tests seem to confirm as much.
